This is a web application. It consists of a single page app, a counter display and three buttons, the central one to START and reset
the application, on the left a button to decrement the counter and on the right a button to increment it.
The application starts with the button START available. Pressing it the application START, number zero flashes for about two seconds 
and then the plus/minus buttons appear.   
If you try to decrement the counter below zero nothing happens because the counter doesn't contemplate negative numbers. 
This is a two digit counter so the maximum number is 99. Afterwards the counter starts again from zero and so on.
After having started the counter the central button shows RESET instead of START. We can now use this button to reset the counter, that is to show zero.
