This application consists of a counter display and two buttons, one of this is deputed to increment the counter 
and the other to decrement it.
The application starts with the counter setted to zero.
If you try to decrement the counter below zero a message will come up on the screen to inform the user that the counter
can't go below zero.
The application has also a button to reset the counter and so let it start from zero again.
